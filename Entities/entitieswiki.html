        <h2 style="text-align:center; font-style:oblique;">Description:</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Numerous entities exist in VOTV, surprisingly, a very small amount of these entities can be spawned manually, while most either spawn naturally, randomly, or have to be forced spawned. Here, there will be three categories: Normal, Anomaly, and Forbidden. Normal, being entities that you come across regularly or aren't very special at all. Anomaly being entities that are somewhat or pretty rare, are special, or very mysterious. Forbidden being extremely rare, sometimes innaccessible, or super special. Some of them have very distinct stories that play into the overall lore of VOTV.</p>

                    The Ariral in VOTV has two variants, one variant being a stalker where it moves when the player moves but stops when the player stops. The stalker variant will still attack the player but in a more subtle way. The other variant is aggressive where the Ariral will hunt down the player, pick up and throw items, and attack the player. The Ariral entity usually and only spawns the <a style="color: greenyellow;" href="../Structures/structureswiki.html#ariraltreehouse">Ariral Treehouse Landmark</a>.

The Ariral entity is representative of the Ariral race created by MrDrNose which is its own entire civilization. 
Three visit the the area that the player plays in, one short and two talls with the short presumably having escaped the shorts totalitarian division at some point. 
The two talls are the ones who mostly prank the player with slaps, item throws, and other events, while the short simply stays out of that business. 
But later the short eventually dies to one of the killer wisps after days 35-40, this is due to the cheap Indis suits that all three of them had on during that time. 
Some messages that are in the form of signals that the player can sometimes find are actually aimed towards the Arirals.
The Arirals come and visit Earth for a specific mission, now as to what that mission is is currently unknown.
The Arirals play a pretty large part to most of the events that appear in Storymode. 
More lore and info on the Arirals can be explored here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DQlaXJOSTuPQrVFDXgtvsl4THpBgAYL3">Ariral Lore Drive</a>.

                    Fossilhound is an extremely aggressive dog-like creature, appearing at nights behind the fence. It will start out in a hole and eventually climb out. Charging at the player as soon as it sees them, it can knock you down multiple times even through the fence. It will continue to chase you until it has hit you. If the player attacks back, the Fossilhound will break apart into a bunch of bones and pieces.

When the entity encounters the player for the first time, it will pin the player down and almost study the player for some time before eventually letting go and moving on. If the player attacks or disturbs the entity on its underside, the entity will fire back with a powerful blast that will insta-kill the player.
