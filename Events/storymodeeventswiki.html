        <p style="text-align:center;">In VOTV there are different gamemodes that you can select and choose to play in, such modes include Story, Infinite, Sandbox, and more. In storymode there are certain scripted events that can occur that do not occur in other modes. These events can have a couple triggers but most of them are usually triggered by the day count.</p>

There will also be 2 figurine toys of the Warp Arrows which you can grab. When you first approach this structure/event an invisible <a style="color: greenyellow;" href="../Entities/entitieswiki.html#ariral">Ariral Entity</a> will be heard running away from you. In the older versions, along with all the items listed here, there used to be a Brynfruit and a Shrimp Burger that could spawn. This is the first encounter with Arirals, as they are checking out the area. Also during this you can catch 2 signals from them. After a few days the two warp arrows and picnic will disappear.</td>

It used to exist in the older versions of VOTV at around 0.3.0 and earlier but was removed in 0.5.0. it would have a Warp Arrow teleport in front of the Main Base and begin scanning the entire environment around it. This also causes your emergency sirens to flare up. The Warp Arrow will continously scan until enough time has passed and it will fly out and teleport creating a massive bright blue wave across the entire map. The Arirals are scanning the environment to ensure of no hazards around. This was supposed to be the event that would first introduce Arirals to the player or first encounter with them. However this was later replaced with the Ariral Picnic Event.</td>

Starting from this point and on each day afterwards, the treehouse will be built up in stages, with each stage supplying different items and objects. The Arirals, after a little more than a week, come back with supplies and construct a treehouse to live at the area. They do this for several days until they are fully settled in.</td>

This gun is the first variant of the prop meaning it can't be used by the player. The Ariral in question either has tripped or fallen hence dropping the gun by accident. Strangely the Ariral doesnt come back to pick it up, most likely to keep itself hidden from the player and ensure it's secrecy.</td>

It will also cause some damage to the surrounding area, soon the object which is an Obelisk will pop up a bright red screen warning the player of the <a style="color: greenyellow;" href="../Entities/entitieswiki.html#kwisp">Killer Wisp Entities</a> which will soon spawn and continue spawning from this point on. The Obelisk and the sign is actually supposed to be warning for the Arirals, not the player. As depicted in the drawings it is an Ariral with it's figure, the Rozitals who are behind this situation sent this obelisk to protect the Arirals in the short term before they send in their Piramid to take care of the Killer Wisps.</td>
