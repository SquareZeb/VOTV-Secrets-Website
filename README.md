# Update:
I am shutting down the Voices of the Void Secrets Archive for the timebeing.
# What's Happening:
I am going to remove the Voices of the Void Secrets Archive from github pages and stop hosting it. However, I will not remove or delete this repository including all the files and assets for this website. Meaning you can still browse this repository and check out it out in its full glory on your local machines.
# Why:
I am shutting down this website for three reasons:
  1.  I have lost all interest in the game Voices of the Void. While the game may be fun for some it isn't for me anymore. I've played this game for over a year now and I personally don't like the direction it is heading and if I'm honest I don't think it will go anywhere in the near future since its development is slow. Hence since I'm not interested I'm more likely to get information wrong within the wiki so I'm just going to avoid angering certain individuals.
  2.  I don't have time anymore. Keeping this website up and running with updated information takes a lot of time off of my hands. I am quite busy with other projects that I deem as more important as the Voices of the Void Archive was mostly just a fun project just to get me into the basics of HTML, Java, and CSS.
  3.  There are other options. I've taken a look at wiki.gg and fandom for voices of the void and in short its good. Not to mention these are run by entire communities as opposed to one person such as myself so I figured I'd let myself take a break while they do all the work. Plus since they are run by entire communities it is easier and much faster to update things whereas it took me weeks to fully update to the next version.
# What's Next:
I will hand this project over to Nerd on discord since Nerd had redone this entire website in VueJS and wants to continue it. Now while the Voices of the Void Secrets Archive will be shut down, the Interactive Map for VOTV will be kept up and running. I will continue the working on and updating the map, so you need not worry about it getting shutdown too.
# Outro:
I thank you all for the support and feedback you all have given me on the website. It was a lot of fun working on it but for now I will be moving on. So I wish you all the best!
