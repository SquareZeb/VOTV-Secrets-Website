# VOTV-Secrets-Website
VOTV Secrets Website is dedicated to archiving all of the secrets, spoilers, and easter eggs in Voices of the Void (VOTV) game developed by MrDrNose. This website includes multiple webpages and sections that detail each part very extensively. This website also aims to keep all information as updated and accurate as possible, as VOTV is still in beta/alpha so it isn't fully released yet. So I'd advise you to expect possible incorrect information, outdated data, and missing details, do not take everything you see on this website literally. Take it with a grain of salt.

## Note:
It is highly recommended that before browsing on this site, actually go play the game of VOTV first. Just so that none of the content or info you see on the site will ruin the game experience for you. But the choice is up to you and yours only. If you choose to browse on this site, you may not share or leak any of the content you view on this site on other platforms, media, or forums. Anything and everything that you see on the website should be kept to yourself. I'm not responsible for ruining anyone's experiences in VOTV.
